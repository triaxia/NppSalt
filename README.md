NppSalt - A simple Notepad++ Plug-in. 

It does two things:

1) It flashes the Notepad++ screen when it detects any of the open files has been changed by other people;

2) It prevents concurrent Notepad++ sessions for overwriting each other's changes.
   
To compile the plug-in, simply open NppSalt.sln using Visual Studio 2010 (or a later version) and build.
To deploy the plug-in, simply copy NppSalt.dll to Notepad++'s Plugins folder.
