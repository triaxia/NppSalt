{"name":"NppSalt","tagline":"Notepad++ Plugin No Overwriting","body":"# NppSalt - A simple Notepad++ Plug-in. \r\n\r\nIt does two things:\r\n\r\n1) It flashes the Notepad++ screen when it detects any of the open files has been changed by other people;\r\n\r\n2) When a file is about to be saved, if NppSalt detects that the file has been changed by other people,\r\n   it will copy the current changes to a \"new\" window and reload the file from disk. This prevents\r\n   people from overwriting each other's changes. Note there is no way for a plug-in to cancel out a \r\n   Notepad++ file save operation, hence this is the best NppSalt can do for now.\r\n   \r\nTo compile the plug-in, simply open NppSalt.sln using Visual Studio 2010 (or a later version) and build.\r\nTo deploy the plug-in, simply copy NppSalt.dll to Notepad++'s Plugins folder.\r\n\r\nPeter Gu\r\npete.x.gu@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
